# heap
1. heap made out void pointers.
2. custom comparision function.
## working
assuming by the comparator function gives negative if first value is less than the second and positive if first is greater than second.
comparator function must accept const void * and give a integer output.
the heap can be initialised by passing the comparator function only once
